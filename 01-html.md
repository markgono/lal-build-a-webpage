# HTML

A *markup language* is a system for annotating a document in a way that is syntactically distinguishable from the text or contents of the document.

HTML is a markup language – it actually stands for HyperText Markup Language – we use it to describe the building blocks of a webpage to the browser.

In terms of how it looks, we use markup to describe the elements that make up a page, so for a header it’s `<h1>Lunch & Learn</h1>`, which describes a header element – the *h* in *h1*, which contains the contents *“Lunch & Learn”*.

On this page, we’re using:
Some required elements:
- *html* – Every page starts and ends with this!
- *head* – For hidden information about the page
- *body* – The substance, everything you see ends up here

Some lesser elements:
- *p* - a paragraph
- *ul* - an unordered list
- *div* - a division. /We use these to separate and group elements together/

HTML elements can also have attributes that further define the element, so for `<img src="http://placekitten.com/200/300" />` we’re defining an image element, that is *sourced* from placekitten.com.

We could also assign an id:
`<h3 id=“#welcome”>Welcome to Gousto</h3>`
or a class:
`<p class="description">Precise ingredients, delicious recipes and a dollop of adventure.</p>`

> Try it out!
> Put this anywhere on the page:
> `<img src="http://placekitten.com/200/300" />`

## HTML Challenge
Let’s try modifying some HTML!

First, let’s modify some contents:
- Name your app  – we’ll be creating a visual catalog of product items!

*Hint:* Look for the `intro`

- Bump up that title – let’s make the middle line more impactful by increasing the header weight.

*Hint:* We covered it above!

## Next Steps
Great, that’s a short intro into HTML essentials.
