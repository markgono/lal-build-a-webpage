Today we’ll be creating a web page. Before we start, there’s a few things we need to know about how a web page is built.

A modern webpage is made up of three distinct parts:

- HTML – a *Document* that contains the *Elements* of a web page
- CSS – *Styling Rules* that tell a web page how to present itself
- JS –  the *Code* that powers the web. When JavaScript is running on our page, it has access to something called the *DOM* (The Document Object Model) which allows it to change our HTML.

This golden trifecta of technologies, when used together, can be used to create webpages and build web apps.

## Goal
The goal of this workshop is to briefly introduce the aspects of the modern web as well as complete some challenges using all three technologies.

## Method
I will be working alongside you to complete the walkthrough - which should be self-explanatory enough for us to go through .

For this task, I’ve provided some of the starting HTML, CSS and JS for us to work with. We’ll be creating a catalog of product items!
